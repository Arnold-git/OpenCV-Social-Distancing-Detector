# OpenCV-Social-Distancing-Detector
In this project I used OpenCV to create a social distance detector. Due to increasing cases of the global pandemic (corona virus) it important for
every one to adhere to social distancing so as to resuce the spread of the virus. \
With the help of computer vision one can monitor if people are adhering to social distancing or not.
The original video show people walking on a street. While the output file is the processed video indicting if people are within safe distance or not
The red boxes show violators while the green boxes shows people within safe distance from each.
This project can be used by law enforcement agencies to enforce social distancing and also monitor compliance level.
